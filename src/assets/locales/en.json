I started out with just Backend and am coding with enthusiasm to this day, however I only rarely encounter new things to learn, which is a little bit sad. With Infrastructure I only started about three years ago. I understand and can apply core principles fluently, but I am still constantly expanding my skillset here. I am an open minded guy, who doesn't take himself too seriously. During my time in this nerve wrecking environment I learned to stay calm under pressure.",
