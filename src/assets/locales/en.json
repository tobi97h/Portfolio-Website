    "kubernetes" : "Kubernetes is a foundational technology, that serves as a platform for any high level deployment you might imagine.",
    "aws" : "Whenever you need true High Availability for fullfilling SLAs, a cloud computing giant like AWS is the best choice.",
    "proxmox" : "AWS & Co come with a hefty price in exchange for their reliability and vast array of integrated services. Any non produciton workload is much cheaper self hosted.",
    "ceph": "To run any form of container / vm orchestration, you need a distributed filesystem. AWS has EBS and for onprem solutions there is but one true king - Ceph. We use it to provide disks for vms and persistent volumes in kubernetes, it also comes with a network filesystem and s3 block storage.",
    "vms": "Virtualization is key in seperating workloads from spefic hosts, enabeling scalability and high availability. Tools like Docker, CRI-O, LXCs or QEMU provide different depths of virtualization for your specific needs.",

    "go" : "Go is the new king of Layer 7, used by everybody for modern http related projects. It has outstanding concurrency and is the basis for Kubernetes, Terraform and many more. If you want to truly max out the use of terraform, you need Go to write custom providers.",
    "ansible": "If Terraform is the Hydra of Infrastructure, Ansbile without a doubt is the Leviathan. It reaches to places Terraform simply can't due to its API-bound nature. Ansible is raw linux, dirty bash scripting and ssh tunnels. With it we create everything terraform needs to even come into existence.",
    "flask": "When writing infrastructure services or k8s extensions like admission controllers that are accessible via HTTP, Python still is the best canditate. We use python in a lot of these cases, because the most valuable resource we need to optimize is not CPU or RAM, but developer time.",
